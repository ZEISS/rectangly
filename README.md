Custom Angular renderer

## Installation

Make sure to have yarn globally installed (`npm install yarn -g`). Now run:

```sh
yarn install
```

This will resolve and install all (development) dependencies.


## Examples

Running the tests is as simple as typing:

```sh
yarn test
```

This will also run the linter. The standalone unit tests are available via `test:unit`. Likewise, we can also easily report the code coverage:

```sh
yarn test:unit --coverage
```

## Versioning

Incrementing the version can be done via `yarn` as well.

```sh
yarn version
```

This will show the current version and ask for a new version. As a result the information in the package.json is updated. Additionally, a git tag is created with the information (automatically prefixed using a "v"). The process could also be automated, e.g., by specifying the new version directly. So, for instance if our new version is "1.2.3" we just use the following command:

```sh
yarn version --new-version 1.2.3
```
