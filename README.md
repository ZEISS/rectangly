A custom Angular 4+ renderer to use React for displaying the views. Ever wanted to use (most of) the React ecosystem in your Angular app? *rectangly* is here to help you out.

## Hello World

Using *rectangly* is as simple as importing it via

```sh
npm i rectangly
```

and applying the following changes to your application root module.

```typescript
import { NgModule, CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { Rectangly } from 'rectangly';
import { MyPageComponent } from './mypage';

@NgModule({
  imports: [BrowserModule],
  providers: [Rectangly],
  schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA],
  declarations: [MyPageComponent],
  bootstrap: [MyPageComponent],
})
export class PageModule {}
```

If you want to use some already created React components you should register them first:


```typescript
import { registerComponents } from 'rectangly';
import { Button } from './mycomponents';

registerComponents('my', {
  Button,
});
```

Using the this custom element in Angular templates is as simple as writing

```html
<my-Button [disabled]="true" (onClick)="toggleDisabled()">Toggle me</my-Button>
```

While standard attributes only supply strings to React, computed attributes (using the square brackets) will pass in the evaluated expression. Passing in functions should always be done via the listener attributes (using the round brackets).
